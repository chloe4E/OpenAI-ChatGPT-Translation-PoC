# OpenAI ChatGPT Translation PoC

This repository serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for connecting to OpenAI's ChatGPT model to generate translations.

## Features

- **Translation Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT model to generate translations of input text.
- **Customizable**: Can be easily adapted to support various languages and translation requirements.
- **Simple Integration**: Provides straightforward integration with OpenAI's API for seamless translation generation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this PoC, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/chloe4E/OpenAI-ChatGPT-Translation-PoC.git`.

2. **Set Up OpenAI API**: Sign up for OpenAI API access and obtain your API key. Refer to OpenAI's documentation for instructions on obtaining the API key. Create a .env file with a variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies by running `npm i`.

4. **Run the PoC**: Execute the PoC script to generate translations using ChatGPT. Customize the input text and target language as needed. Run it with `node .`.

5. **Explore Results**: Explore the generated translations and evaluate the accuracy and quality of the outputs. Adjust parameters or refine the prompt text for better results if necessary.

## Usage

To use this PoC, follow these usage guidelines:

1. **Input Text**: Provide the input text that you want to translate. This can be in any language supported by ChatGPT.

2. **Target Language**: Specify the target language for the translation. ChatGPT will generate the translation based on this language.

3. **API Key**: Set up your OpenAI API key in the script to authenticate and access ChatGPT.

4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to generate translations using ChatGPT. `node .`

5. **Review Output**: Review the translated text generated by ChatGPT. Verify the accuracy and fluency of the translations.

6. **Iterate and Improve**: Iterate on the input text, target language, and other parameters to improve the quality of translations over time.
